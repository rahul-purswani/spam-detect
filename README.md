# Spam Detect - Bernoulli Classifier from Scratch
This repository showcases a Bernoulli Classifier designed to meticulously filter spam from legitimate SMS messages (ham/spam). Constructed from the ground up, the classifier harnesses the robust ham/spam dataset to compute conditional probabilities and apply the principles of Bernoulli Naive Bayes for effective spam detection. Central to this project is the meticulous management of a vocabulary dictionary, critical for analyzing and processing the text data accurately.
